# PowerBi_Dashboard
Here is a quick look on the interactive dashboard I build on Attrition rate to help company retain their employees

Got a data in a raw format. Had leverage the use of power query editor in Power BI to transform, clean and sort the data in required format useful for further analysis and building reports and dashboard. 

which includes but not limited to 
<br/>Merging queries 
<br/>Adding multiple conditional columns 
<br/>Handling null values
<br/>Removing redundant columns
<br/>Using delimiters to required info in seperate columns
<br/>Validating the information and many more

Made an interactive dashboard depending on the important KPI and metrics.
